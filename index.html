        <p></p><p>I am <strong><em>Emmanuel Ayooluwa AKINDE</em></strong>, i hav had a lot of nick names over the years Beanne and #OmoIyaEmma are the popular ones.
I am extremely passionate about TECH. i have become addicted to learning new technology .I am someone who is always moved by works of other fellow programmers which solves real time problems and are scalable. </p>

<p>Ill be like "I NEED TO CONFORM TO THIS MOVEMENT". </p>

<p>I have worked with a few technologies ranging from <em>Networking</em> -&gt; <em> Embedded systems.</em>â†’ <em>Web Dev</em> and desire to learn a lot more.</p>

<p>This year (2017), as a step forward i am determined to act on the things procrastination has deterred me from doing. Started my internship with KONGA ONLINE SHOPPING MALL</p>

</h3>

<p><em><strong>TECHNICAL</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>C++ (Intermediate)</strong>::  I have a soft spot for C++ being the first language I learnt as at  2012. As at then i didnt even understand it i had to first take FORTRAN in OAU to understand programming, have not been able to develop it tho. But i have plans to use it for my final year project in Artificial Intelligence and Game Physics </p>

<p><strong>Javascript (Intermediate)</strong>  :: Javascript has gradually become a force to reckon with and isn't going anywhere soon. I want to make friends with this monopolistic tool. 
Finally got hold of NODEJS and it has been beautiful.</p>

<p><strong>PHP(Intermediate) </strong> :: This is the only language i hav a very fast learning curve with, trying to gain enough experience to develop my own pattern and really thirst for elegance in my craft.</p>
        
<p><strong>Swift and Objective C (Beginner)</strong>  :: So i go my self a MAC BOOK PRO YAAY. All because i wanted to learn iOS development. this two languages are crazy men, But a man has to do what he has to do</p>
<p>I want to build complex and rich back-end applications. I AM IN.</p>



<p><em><strong>DEVELOPMENT</strong></em></p>

<p>I am basically a NERD. </p>

<p> MY DEVELOPMENT SCHEME IS TO READ A LOT OF BOOKS AND PROJECTS TAKING NOTE OF DESIGN PATTERNS, STYLES, ALGORITHMS E.T.C</p>

<p>May the force be with us all and God bless.</p>
