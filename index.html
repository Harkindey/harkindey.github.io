</h3>

<p><em><strong>TECHNICAL</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Javascript (Intermediate)</strong>  :: Javascript has gradually become a force to reckon with and isn't going anywhere soon. I want to make friends with this monopolistic tool. 
Finally got hold of NODEJS and it has been beautiful.</p>

<p><strong>PHP(Intermediate) </strong> :: This is the only language i have a very fast learning curve with, trying to gain enough experience to develop my own pattern and really thirst for elegance in my craft.</p>
        
<p><strong>Swift and Objective C (Beginner)</strong>  :: So i got my self a MAC BOOK PRO YAAY. All because i wanted to learn iOS development. this two languages are crazy men, But a man has to do what he has to do</p>
<p>I want to build complex and rich back-end applications. I AM IN.</p>

<p><em><strong>DEVELOPMENT</strong></em></p>
        
<p> MY DEVELOPMENT SCHEME IS TO READ A LOT OF BOOKS AND PROJECTS TAKING NOTE OF DESIGN PATTERNS, STYLES, ALGORITHMS E.T.C</p>
        
<p> I will be Building Mobile apps for the ios platform with SWIFT and React Native </p>
<p> Backend Apps with NodeJs and PHP </p>        


<p>May the force be with us all and God bless.</p>
