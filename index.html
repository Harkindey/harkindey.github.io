        <p></p><p>I am <strong><em>Emmanuel Ayooluwa AKINDE</em></strong>, i hav had a lot of nick names over the years Beanne and #OmoIyaEmma are the popular ones.
I am extremely passionate about reading . i have become addicted to learning new technology .I am someone who is always moved by works of other fellow programmers which solves real time problems and are scalable. </p>

<p>Ill be like "I NEED TO CONFORM TO THIS MOVEMENT". </p>

<p>I have worked with a few technologies ranging from <em>Networking</em> -&gt; <em> Embedded systems.</em>â†’ <em>Web Dev</em> and desire to learn a lot more.</p>

<p>This year (2016), as a step forward i am determined to act on the things procrastination has deterred me from doing.</p>

</h3>

<p><em><strong>TECHNICAL</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>C++ (Intermediate)</strong>::  I have a soft spot for C++ being the first language I learnt as at  2012. As at then i didnt even understand it i had to first take FORTRAN in IFE to understand, have not been able to develop it tho. But i am still in love </p>

<p><strong>Python (Intermediate)</strong> :: The language is clearly beautiful and beginner friendly. 
I will be using the language for web dev and Cryptography </p>

<p><strong>Javascript (Beginner)</strong>  :: Javascript has gradually become a force to reckon with and isn't going anywhere soon. I want to make friends with this monopolistic tool. 
I want in on this one too.</p>

<p><strong>PHP(Codeigniter) (Intermediate) </strong> :: This is the only language i hav a very fast learning curve with, trying to gain enough experience to develop my own pattern and really thirst for elegance in my craft.</p>

<p>I want to build complex and rich back-end applications. I AM IN.</p>

<p>I AM DEEP IN THE ZONE.</p>

<p>I AM SUPER IN.</p>

<p><em><strong>DEVELOPMENT</strong></em></p>

<p>I am basically a bookworm #NERD. </p>

<p> MY DEVELOPMENT SCHEME IS TO READ A LOT OF BOOKS AND PROJECTS TAKING NOTE OF DESIGN PATTERNS, STYLES, ALGORITHMS E.T.C</p>

<p>May the force be with us all and God bless.</p>
