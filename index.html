          <p></p><p>I am <strong><em>Emmanuel Ayooluwa AKINDE</em></strong>, i hav had a lot of nick names over the years Beanne and #OmoIyaEmma are the popular ones.
I am extremely passionate about reading . i have become addicted to learning new technology .I like to  see myself as an individual who is always moved by works of other fellow programmers which solves real time problems and are scalable. </p>

<p>Ill be like "I NEED TO CONFORM TO THIS MOVEMENT". </p>

<p>I have worked with a few technologies ranging from <em>Networking</em> -&gt; <em> Embedded systems.</em>â†’ <em>Web Dev</em> and desire to learn a lot more.</p>

<p>This year (2016), as a step forward i am determined to act on the things procrastination has deterred me from doing.</p>

</h3>

<p><em><strong>TECHNICAL</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>C++ (Intermediate)</strong>::  I have a soft spot for C++ being the first language I learnt as at  2012. As at then i didnt even understand it i had to first take FORTRAN in IFE to understand, have not been able to develop it tho. But i am still in love </p>

<p><strong>Python (Intermediate)</strong> :: The language is clearly beautiful and beginner friendly. 
I will be using the language for web dev and Cryptography </p>

<p><strong>Javascript (Beginner)</strong>  :: Javascript has gradually become a force to reckon with and isn't going anywhere soon. I want to make friends with this monopolistic tool. 
I want in on this one too.</p>

<p><strong>PHP(Codeigniter) (Intermediate) </strong> :: This is the only language i hav a very fast learning curve with, trying to gain enough experience to develop my own pattern and really thirst for elegance in my craft.</p>

<p>I want to build complex and rich back-end applications. I AM IN.</p>

<p>I AM DEEP IN THE ZONE.</p>

<p>I AM SUPER IN.</p>

<p><em><strong>DEVELOPMENT</strong></em></p>

<p>I am an avid reader #NERD. </p>

<p> MY DEVELOPMENT SCHEME IS TO READ A LOT OF BOOKS AND PROJECTS TAKING NOTE OF DESIGN PATTERNS, STYLES, ALGORITHMS E.T.C</p>

<p>May the force be with us all and God bless.</p>
